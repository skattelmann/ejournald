ejournald
=========

Ejournald is an Erlang interface for systemd's journald. It provides advanced write and read support.

Installation
------------

Ejournald consists of two parts: the first part is a nif for the communication with journald, the second is an Erlang interface.

First, you have to compile the sources in c_src/ using make. Next you can compile the erlang source in src/. 

Installation using tetrapak
--------------------------
You can build the project by executing "tetrapak build". 

Usage
-----

Ejournald is intended to provide logging support for [journald](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html). Together with [lager](https://github.com/basho/lager) and the [lager_journald_backend](https://github.com/travelping/lager_journald_backend) it allows to write structured logs with additional metainformation into systemd's journal. Logging directly with ejournald is also possible (via the NIF-API) but it is recommended to use lager. On top of that ejournald provides:

- an [**Erlang I/O-server**](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/io_protocol.html) for stream-like logging
- a high-level API for retrieving logs 

The I/O-server is is not capable of reading the journal. It can be used as an IO devide together with the [erlang:io](http://erlang.org/doc/man/io.html) library. Therefore commands like *io:format()* or *io:write()* can be used in a very convenient way to write stuff into the journal without using lager. By default an I/O-server named *ejournald_io_server* is started together with ejournald. The log level (by default *info*) and other options are fixed for one I/O-server. Thus if you need other options (e.g. another log level) you need to start your own one. Note that the 'name' option (a string) is mandatory and you have to deliver a unique name for every server. This name will appear as a prefix in the journal.
The high-level API for reading logs consists of the two function get_logs/1 and log_notify/1. The first one will enable you to retrieve logs based on time-frames. The latter one is intended to deliver new logs as they appear in the journal. It is therefore possible to build simple monitoring systems using this API. Logs are always delivered of the form

```erlang
 **{Timestamp, LogLevel, LogData}**
```

where Timestamp is of type [calendar:datetime1970()](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/calendar.html#type-datetime1970), LogLevel is one of the eight journald log levels and LogData is a string or a list of strings. As an example 

```erlang
    LastLogs = ejournald:get_logs([{at_most, 10}, {message, true}]),
    ejournald:log_notify(self(), [{message, true}]),
    flush(). % some new logs might appear here 
```

is roughly equivalent to 'journalctl -f' giving you the last 10 logs in message-only format (just one string per log) and following the journal if new logs appear. Leaving the 'message'-option would give you whole logs (a list of strings per log). The 'Options' parameter is always intended to filter the choice of logs. Just 'ejournald:get_logs([])' would reproduce the whole journal. To restrict the time-frame of logs (for get_logs()) you can use the options 'since' and 'until'. The order of logs is always destined by the 'direction'-option (by default 'top' - from newest to oldest). Another example:

```erlang
    Logs = ejournald:get_logs([{log_level, alarm}, {direction, bot}, {since, {{2013,12,31},{12,0,0}} }]).
```

This gives you full logs in the order 'oldest to newest' since lunchtime of last silvester with log level at most 'alarm'. Note that you must use UTC-time. If possible filtering should be done by ejournald since the used C-API in the background is much faster at handling this. You can use as many different log_notify()'s as you want at the same time. Different filters will be handled properly. Filtering by (Erlang-) applications and other meta-data is planned for the future.
